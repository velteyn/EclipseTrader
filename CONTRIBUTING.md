## Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to EclipseTrader? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

*   [Good first issues](https://github.com/velteyn/EclipseTrader/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
*   [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/velteyn/EclipseTrader/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

### Getting Started

To get started with your first code contribution, you'll need to set up your development environment. Please refer to the [README.md](README.md) for detailed instructions on how to do this.

Once you have your development environment set up, you can start making changes to the code. Here's the general workflow for contributing to EclipseTrader:

1.  **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the [EclipseTrader GitHub page](https://github.com/velteyn/EclipseTrader). This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch in your forked repository. This is where you'll make your changes. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `fix-bug-123` or `add-new-feature`.
3.  **Make your changes**: Make your changes to the code. Be sure to follow the coding standards outlined in the "Coding Standards" section below.
4.  **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes to your new branch. Be sure to use a descriptive commit message, as outlined in the "Commit Message Conventions" section below.
5.  **Push your changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
6.  **Submit a pull request**: Open a pull request from your forked repository to the main EclipseTrader repository. Be sure to include a detailed description of your changes in the pull request.

### Coding Standards

We want to keep the EclipseTrader codebase clean and consistent. To that end, we have a few coding standards that we ask all contributors to follow:

*   **Code Formatting**: We use the standard Java code formatting conventions. Please make sure your code is properly formatted before submitting a pull request.
*   **Naming Conventions**: We follow the standard Java naming conventions. Please use descriptive names for your classes, methods, and variables.
*   **Comments**: We encourage the use of comments to explain complex parts of the code. However, please don't over-comment your code. The code should be self-documenting as much as possible.

### Commit Message Conventions

We use a conventional commit message format to make it easier to track changes to the codebase. Please follow this format when writing your commit messages:

```
feat: Add new feature
fix: Fix bug
docs: Add or update documentation
style: Make formatting changes
refactor: Refactor code
test: Add or update tests
chore: Make changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
```

The first line of your commit message should be a short summary of your changes, followed by a blank line and a more detailed description of your changes.

### Pull Request Process

Once you've submitted a pull request, the EclipseTrader maintainers will review your changes. We may ask you to make some changes to your code before we merge your pull request. Please be patient, as it may take some time for us to review your changes.

We use a continuous integration (CI) system to automatically test all pull requests. If your pull request fails the CI tests, we'll ask you to fix the tests before we merge your pull request.
