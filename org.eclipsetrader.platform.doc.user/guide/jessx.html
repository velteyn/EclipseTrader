<h1>JESSX Stock Market Simulator</h1>

<p>
JESSX is a powerful stock market simulator integrated into EclipseTrader. It allows you to create and run complex trading scenarios, test automated trading strategies using bots, and analyze market behavior in a controlled environment.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
JESSX scenarios are standard XML files that define assets, institutions, participant types, robots and optional news/information. You can select and manage scenarios directly in the application:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open <b>Preferences → Plugins → JessX! Scenarios</b>.</li>
    <li>Pick a bundled scenario (e.g., <code>default.xml</code>, <code>bull-market.xml</code>, <code>bear-market.xml</code>, <code>volatile-market.xml</code>).</li>
    <li>Or click <b>Browse…</b> to select any <code>.xml</code> file on disk.</li>
    <li>You can drop custom scenario files into the folder <code>&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipsetrader.jessx/scenarios/</code>; they will appear in the list automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When a bundled scenario is selected, it is copied to the plug‑in state area the first time you run it, so you can further edit it. Scenarios define:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Assets:</b> The securities (stocks) available for trading.</li>
    <li><b>Institutions:</b> The market makers or exchanges where assets are traded.</li>
    <li><b>Player Types:</b> The different categories of participants in the simulation.</li>
    <li><b>Robots (Bots):</b> The automated trading agents that will participate in the simulation. Each bot has a specific trading strategy.</li>
    <li><b>News Items:</b> Simulated news events that can influence market behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running a Simulation</h2>
<p>
Select a scenario in Preferences, ensure the JESSX broker is configured, then click the “Play” button in the main toolbar. This starts the JESSX server and connects the bots and the human player to the simulation defined by the chosen scenario.
</p>
<p>
The simulation will start, and you will see the market data updating in real-time in the watchlists and charts. You can interact with the simulation by placing orders manually, just as you would with a real broker.
</p>

<h2>Trading Bots</h2>
<p>
The JESSX simulator includes several types of trading bots, each with a different trading strategy. Bots are configured in the scenario XML and implemented in Java within the <code>org.eclipsetrader.jessx</code> plug‑in. Common bots include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Discreet:</b> A bot that trades based on market trends.</li>
    <li><b>DiscreetIT:</b> A variation of the Discreet bot.</li>
    <li><b>NotDiscreet:</b> A more aggressive trading bot.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The bots will automatically start trading once the simulation begins. You can observe their activity in the orders view.
</p>

<h2>Custom Scenarios</h2>
<p>
To add your own scenario:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create an XML file following the structure of the bundled scenarios.</li>
    <li>Place it under <code>&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipsetrader.jessx/scenarios/</code> or use <b>Browse…</b> in Preferences to select it.</li>
    <li>Select it in <b>Preferences → Plugins → JessX! Scenarios</b> and apply the changes.</li>
</ol>
