Java Experimental Simulated Stock Exchange

Main goal

JessX Project's main goal is to create a program allowing for the simulation of a financial market with realistic features (such as an order book and realistic orders). Researchers and teachers in Finance may find it helpful in their works. It is, ceteris-paribus, inspired by the Euronext- NYSE microstructure (order-driven, continuous). 

This project origially appeared on http://jessx.net/ but maybe for lack of interest disappeared..
I bring it to life again with sources of the latest 1.6 version
